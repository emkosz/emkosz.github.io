**Keith Huang's portfolio**

Keith Huang is landsacpe designer based in Hongkong. He needed a website to show his work in project he's been involved in. We went for an image driven design with each image leading to a more detailed description of the projects. We are closing up the project in a couple of weeks.

The website is written in Rails 5. I've used Bootstrap to some extend and a hole lot of scss tweeking. Images are hosted on Cloudinary, Website is hosted on Heroku.

Website, Code

**Mate Memo**

Mate Memo is an app that I'm building with Nevyn Bengtsson. The idea is to be able to add friends from social media accounts to this appp and to write description, and add reminders and tags about the person. This to get better at keeping in touch, remeber where one met eachother, keep people in mind for future adventure. So far one can sign up with twitter and add from recent friends as well as adding friends throug a form. 

The website is written in Rails 4.3. We use a twitter gem to do the api calling. To handle sign up and accounts we use Devise.

**Bridge US**

I interned as a full stack Ruby on Rails developer for Bridge US. They are a startup in the migration sector with a web app where companies and non profits can better collaborate on visa applicatons. I worked on UI improvments, increasde the overall testcoverage and implemented a notification preference feature.

Stack was Rails 4.2. Rspec, Capybara to name a few.

**Micropost App**

I went through Michal Hartls Rails tutorial to teach myself Rails. The result is a twitter clone that allows users to write micropost, upload pictures, follow and be followed by other users.

The website is written in Rails 4.2. Images are hosted on AWS and website is hosted on Heroku.

**CocoaPods contribution**

During a three months program called Rails Girl Summer of Code a friend and I contributed to CocoaPods. CocoaPods is iOS depenency manager that allows users to maintain third party libraries as well as sharing libraries for others to use. My main contribution was to modularize the codebase by moving search to it's own gem. We also built a plugin to notate podfiles with pod descriptions. I've written a couple of blogpost about this project to be found in Post.

CocoaPods is written in Ruby. Test's are written in Bacon. Travis for build.
