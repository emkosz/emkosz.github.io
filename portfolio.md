### Keith Huang's portfolio

<img src="/assets/images/keith_screenshot.png" alt="Keith Screenshot">

Keith Huang is landscape designer who was in need of a website to show off the projects he's been involved in. We thought an image driven design, with each image leading to a more detailed description would suit well. This project is undergoing and will be closing up in a couple of weeks.

The website is written in Rails 5. I've used Bootstrap to some extent, and a whole lot of SCSS tweeking. Images are hosted on Cloudinary, website is hosted on Heroku.

### Mate Memo

<img src="/assets/images/matememo_screenshot.png" alt="MateMemo Screenshot">

Mate Memo is an app that I'm building with Nevyn Bengtsson. The idea is to import friends from social media accounts, and then write notes, add reminders and tags about the person. This to get better at keeping in touch, remember where one met eachother, and to keep people in mind for future adventures. So far one can sign up with Twitter and import friends from recent twitter contacts, as well as adding friends through a form. 

The website is written in Rails 4.2. We use [the twitter gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/twitter) to do the API calling. To handle sign up and accounts we use [Devise](https://rubygems.org/gems/devise).

### Bridge US

I interned as a full stack Ruby on Rails developer for Bridge US. They are a startup in the migration sector with a web app where companies and non-profits can better collaborate on US visa applicatons. I worked on UI improvments, increased the overall test coverage and implemented a notification preferences feature.

Stack was Rails 4.2. Rspec, Capybara to name a few.

### Micropost App

<img src="/assets/images/sampleapp_screenshot.png" alt="Sample App Screenshot">

I went through [Michael Hartl's Rails tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/) to teach myself Rails. The result is a Twitter clone that allows users to write micro-posts, upload pictures, follow and be followed by other users.

The website is written in Rails 4.2.2. Images are hosted on AWS and website is hosted on Heroku.

### CocoaPods contribution

During a three months program called [Rails Girl Summer of Code](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/), a friend and I contributed to [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/). CocoaPods is iOS depenency manager that allows users to maintain third party libraries as well as sharing libraries for others to use. My main contribution was to modularize the codebase by moving [cocoapods-search to its own gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/cocoapods-search). We also built a plug-in to annotate podfiles with pod descriptions. I've written a couple of blog posts about this project (which can be found under [Posts](/posts)).
